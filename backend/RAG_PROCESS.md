# SmartDocRAG: Detailed Explanation of RAG Processes

## 📖 Introduction

SmartDocRAG is a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system that combines semantic search with natural language generation to answer questions based on documents. This document explains in detail how each process works.

---

## 🔧 1. Chunking Process

### What is Chunking?

**Chunking** is the process of dividing a large document into smaller, manageable pieces. This is necessary because:

- **Token Limitations**: AI models have context limits
- **Search Precision**: Smaller chunks allow more precise search
- **Efficiency**: Processing small pieces is faster

### How it Works in SmartDocRAG

```typescript
export function chunkText(text: string, maxLength: number = 500): string[] {
  const sentences = text.match(/[^\.!\?]+[\.!\?]+/g) || [];
  const chunks: string[] = [];
  let currentChunk = "";

  for (const sentence of sentences) {
    if ((currentChunk + sentence).length <= maxLength) {
      currentChunk += sentence;
    } else {
      if (currentChunk) {
        chunks.push(currentChunk.trim());
      }
      currentChunk = sentence;
    }
  }

  if (currentChunk) {
    chunks.push(currentChunk.trim());
  }

  return chunks;
}
```

### Chunking Strategy

1. **Sentence Division**: Uses regex to identify sentence endings (`.`, `!`, `?`)
2. **Context Preservation**: Keeps complete sentences whenever possible
3. **Character Limit**: Maximum 500 characters per chunk
4. **Continuity**: If a sentence doesn't fit, starts a new chunk

### Practical Example

**Original Document:**

```
"The payment system accepts credit cards. It also accepts PIX and bank slips. To use a card, enter the data on screen. PIX is instant and secure."
```

**Generated Chunks:**

```
Chunk 1: "The payment system accepts credit cards. It also accepts PIX and bank slips."
Chunk 2: "To use a card, enter the data on screen. PIX is instant and secure."
```

## 🧠 2. Embedding Process

### What are Embeddings?

**Embeddings** are vector representations of text that capture the **semantic meaning** of words and phrases. In simple terms:

- Transform text into numbers (vectors)
- Texts with similar meanings have similar vectors
- Enable "semantic mathematics" (similarity search)

### The text-embedding-3-small Model

OpenAI's **text-embedding-3-small** is a specialized model that:

#### Technical Characteristics

- **Dimensions**: 1536 numbers per vector
- **Type**: Transformer model trained on billions of texts
- **Precision**: High semantic quality
- **Speed**: Optimized for performance

#### How it Works Internally

1. **Tokenization**: Divides text into tokens (subwords)
2. **Encoding**: Passes through transformer layers
3. **Attention**: Calculates relationships between words in context
4. **Pooling**: Combines information into a single vector
5. **Normalization**: Adjusts vector for efficient comparisons

#### Embedding Example

```
Text: "credit card payment"
Embedding: [0.12, -0.34, 0.67, ..., 0.89] (1536 numbers)

Text: "paying with card"
Embedding: [0.15, -0.31, 0.71, ..., 0.85] (similar vectors!)
```

### What is Stored in the Database

In PostgreSQL with pgvector, we store:

```sql
CREATE TABLE chunks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    document_id INTEGER,
    content TEXT,                    -- Original chunk text
    embedding vector(1536),          -- 1536-dimensional vector
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Record Example

```sql
INSERT INTO chunks VALUES (
    1,
    42,
    'The system accepts PIX payments.',
    '[0.12,-0.34,0.67,...,0.89]',    -- 1536 numbers!
    NOW()
);
```

### Why 1536 Dimensions?

Each dimension captures different aspects of meaning:

- **Dimension 1**: May represent "financial concepts"
- **Dimension 500**: May represent "user actions"
- **Dimension 1200**: May represent "technology/system"
- **Etc...** (the model learns this automatically)

---

## 🔍 3. Query Process (Semantic Search)

### Process Overview

When you ask a question, the system:

1. **Converts question to embedding**
2. **Searches for similar chunks in database**
3. **Retrieves relevant context**
4. **Generates answer using AI**

### Step 1: Question Embedding

```typescript
const embeddingRes = await openaiClient.embeddings.create({
  model: "text-embedding-3-small",
  input: question, // "How to make payment?"
});

const vector = embeddingRes?.data[0]?.embedding;
// Result: [0.18, -0.29, 0.74, ..., 0.91] (1536 numbers)
```

**Why use the same model?**

- **Consistency**: Same "vector space"
- **Comparability**: Vectors can be compared mathematically
- **Precision**: Same semantic "language"

### Step 2: Similarity Search in PostgreSQL

```sql
SELECT content, embedding <-> $1 AS distance
FROM chunks
ORDER BY distance ASC
LIMIT 5
```

#### How the `<->` Operator Works

The `<->` operator calculates **cosine distance** between vectors:

```
distance = 1 - (question_vector · chunk_vector) / (|question_vector| × |chunk_vector|)
```

##### Mathematical Formula Breakdown

Let's break this formula into parts to understand each component:

**1. Dot Product (·)**

```
question_vector · chunk_vector = a₁×b₁ + a₂×b₂ + a₃×b₃ + ... + a₁₅₃₆×b₁₅₃₆
```

The dot product multiplies each corresponding dimension and sums everything. The higher this value, the more "aligned" the vectors are.

**Simplified Example (3 dimensions):**

```
Vector A: [0.5, 0.3, 0.8]
Vector B: [0.4, 0.6, 0.7]

Dot product = (0.5×0.4) + (0.3×0.6) + (0.8×0.7)
            = 0.2 + 0.18 + 0.56
            = 0.94
```

**2. Vector Magnitude (| |)**

```
|vector| = √(a₁² + a₂² + a₃² + ... + a₁₅₃₆²)
```

The magnitude is the "length" of the vector in multidimensional space.

**Simplified Example:**

```
|Vector A| = √(0.5² + 0.3² + 0.8²) = √(0.25 + 0.09 + 0.64) = √0.98 ≈ 0.99
|Vector B| = √(0.4² + 0.6² + 0.7²) = √(0.16 + 0.36 + 0.49) = √1.01 ≈ 1.00
```

**3. Cosine Similarity**

```
similarity = (question_vector · chunk_vector) / (|question_vector| × |chunk_vector|)
```

This is the **cosine of the angle** between the two vectors. The result ranges from -1 to 1:

- **1.0**: Vectors point in same direction (very similar)
- **0.0**: Vectors are perpendicular (neutral)
- **-1.0**: Vectors point in opposite directions (opposite)

**Complete Example:**

```
similarity = 0.94 / (0.99 × 1.00) = 0.94 / 0.99 ≈ 0.949
```

**4. Distance Conversion**

```
distance = 1 - similarity
```

pgvector converts similarity to distance for easier sorting:

- **Distance 0.0**: Maximum similarity (1.0 - 1.0 = 0.0)
- **Distance 1.0**: Minimum similarity (1.0 - 0.0 = 1.0)
- **Distance 2.0**: Opposite vectors (1.0 - (-1.0) = 2.0)

**Final Example:**

```
distance = 1 - 0.949 = 0.051 (very similar!)
```

##### Why This Math Works?

**Geometric Intuition:**

- Imagine vectors as arrows in space
- Small angle = similar texts
- Large angle = different texts
- Cosine measures exactly this angle!

**Cosine Distance Advantages:**

- **Size Independent**: Long and short texts are comparable
- **Direction Focused**: More about "type" of meaning
- **Robust**: Works well with normalized embeddings
- **Efficient**: PostgreSQL optimizes these operations

#### Distance Interpretation

- **0.0**: Identical vectors (very similar text)
- **0.2**: Very semantically similar
- **0.5**: Moderately related
- **0.8**: Slightly related
- **1.0**: Completely different

#### Search Example

**Question**: "How to pay with card?"
**Embedding**: [0.18, -0.29, 0.74, ...]

**Database Results:**

```sql
content                                    | distance
------------------------------------------|----------
"Enter card data on screen"               | 0.15     ← Very similar!
"The system accepts credit cards"         | 0.23     ← Similar
"PIX is an instant payment method"        | 0.45     ← Related
"Bank slip expires in 3 days"             | 0.67     ← Slightly related
"Contact technical support"               | 0.82     ← Not related
```

### Step 3: Context Construction

```typescript
const context = results.rows.map((r: any) => r.content).join("\n---\n");
```

**Resulting Context:**

```
Enter card data on screen
---
The system accepts credit cards
---
PIX is an instant payment method
---
Bank slip expires in 3 days
---
Contact technical support
```

### Why RAG Works Better than GPT Alone?

#### RAG Advantages

1. **Updated Information**: Uses domain-specific data
2. **Precision**: Bases responses on concrete facts
3. **Traceability**: Shows which chunks were used
4. **Control**: You control information sources
5. **Economy**: Smaller models with specific context

#### Comparison

**GPT Alone:**

```
Question: "How to pay with card in XYZ system?"
Answer: "Generally systems accept cards..." (generic)
```

**RAG:**

```
Question: "How to pay with card in XYZ system?"
Context: XYZ system specific documentation
Answer: "In XYZ system, enter the data..." (specific!)
```
